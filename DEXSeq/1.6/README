-----------------------------------------
A Galaxy wrapper for DEXSeq version 1.6.0
-----------------------------------------

DEXSeq is focused on finding differential exon usage using RNA-seq exon counts between samples with different experimental designs. 
DEXSeq: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html

Requirements:
-------------
    Python, HTSeq package :- Preprocessing of sequencing reads and GFF files
    R, Bio-conductor package :- Required for DEXSeq 
    SAMTOOLS :- Sequencing read processing 

Contents:
---------

./bin 
    Contains a config file for running DEXSeq in different settings, setup_dexseq-hts.sh
    will help to create the config file according to your local work station. 

./setup_dexseq-hts.sh
    Setup script, which helps to set the right path to the config file present in the bin
    folder. 
    
./README 
    Basic information about the wrapper 

./galaxy 
    Galaxy tool configuration file can be found here. 

./src
    All relevant scripts for DEXSeq execution, Please follow the shell script to 
    understand the details.
