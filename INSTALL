Before using oqtans package, 

Run
   ./oqtans_make.sh all
    to compile all needed software components of oqtans tools.

Include the content of 
    tool_conf.xml.oqtans
    into your galaxy's tool_conf.xml file and SEE the ./README file 
    for integrating built-in genome reference index to the tools.
   
Source oqtans/oqtans_config.sh and restart galaxy instace.

Now you should be able to use oqtans with or without your GALAXY instance.
