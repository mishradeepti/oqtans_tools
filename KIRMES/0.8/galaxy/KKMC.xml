**Introduction**

This is KIRMES: Kernel-based Identification of Regulatory Modules
in Euchromatic Sequences. KIRMES predicts coregulation based on
gene sets that exhibit similar behavior. 

You can upload a pair of FASTA files, containing the regulatory region
of genes e.g. from a microarray experiment, ChIP-chip binding or 
next generation sequencing data. A comparison to common motif finding 
methods and data about its effectiveness has been published in [1].

The following is a description of the Motif Finding, Training and 
Prediction tools found on this web server.

If you have additional questions about KIRMES, please write an
email to sebi@tue.mpg.de. For problems with our Galaxy server, please 
write to galaxy@raetschlab.org

**Motif Finders** 

In a first step, KIRMES identifies the "interesting" areas of the 
regulatory regions in the input data, using common motif finding algorithms.
You can choose between a simple k-mer counting strategy (fastest), the INCLUSive
MotifSampler developed by Gert Thijs et al. [2], and PRIORITY, a state-of-the-art
Gibbs sampler, developed by Raluca Gordan et al. [3]. These programs return a list of 
50-200 motifs and their best-matching location in each entry of the FASTA file. 

*This is the k-mer counting tool [1]*

It is important to upload both a positive and a negative dataset. Here, positive 
means the FASTA file contains mainly regulatory regions from genes that
are suspected to be co-regulated, e.g. as shown by an experiment. The negative 
dataset consists of regulatory regions of genes that are not regulated by the same 
mechanism as the ones in the positive set. Such a set can be obtained, for example, 
from unbound regions in a ChIP-chip experiment. The ratio of positive examples to 
negative examples should be the same as the one expected in the prediction dataset.
For instance, if 10% of the genome are suspected to be regulated by the mechanism
under scrutiny, the ratio should be 1:10 positives:negatives.
