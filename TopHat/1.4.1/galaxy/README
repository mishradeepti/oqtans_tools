Tophat use the same Bowtie index set. To create the new genome index

Usage: bowtie-build [option] genome.fa index_basename

and add the entries in "bowtie_indices.loc". Please make sure that the 
fields are tab delimited, not space delimited, and have no trailing or 
extra whitespace (this is easy to slip in by accident). 

Place the .loc file under $GALAXY_PATH/tool-data/

Add the table details to main "tool_data_table_conf.xml" to get load the
built-in index in the TopHat interface.
