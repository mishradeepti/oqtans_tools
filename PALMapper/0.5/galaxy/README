PALMapper use the same as GenomeMapper index set. To create the new genome index

Usage: $OQTANS_PATH/PALMapper/0.5/pmidex genome.fa

and add the entries in "genomemapper_indices.loc". Please make sure that the 
fields are tab delimited, not space delimited, and have no trailing or 
extra whitespace (this is easy to slip in by accident). 

Place the .loc file under $GALAXY_PATH/tool-data/

Please adapt the path in qpalma_parameters.loc according to the local deployment
to get the default QPALMA parameter file in the PALMapper interface.
